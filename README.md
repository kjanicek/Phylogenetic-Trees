# Phylogenetic-Trees
I have uploaded all of the svg images of the trees. For me, they open in chrome and can be visualized to 500% magnification. Obviously the homeobox tree is still quite difficult to visualize given the large size of the tree. I am hopeful that this can be accessed via figtree or another phylogenetic tree software that allows for better visualization of the trees. 
The contree data contains the nwk files
Heatmaps 1-8 show in pairs for each TF family and for Nematostella/Human and Aurelia/Human.
